# tinycrypto

tinycrypto is a collection of cryptographic primitives implemented in [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad). Because certain cryptographic schemes(e.g lattice cryptography, polynomial operations) require quite of an matrix operations, we began experimenting with the idea of leveraging tinygradâ€™s hyper-optimized `Tensor` data structure. Could this approach lead to a fast yet user-friendly Python cryptography library?
